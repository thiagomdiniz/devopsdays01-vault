## About

To facilitate the demonstration, only one Git repository organized into folders was used, but in a real environment, the ideal would be for each folder to be a different repository.

> Do not run a Vault dev server in production. This approach starts a Vault server with an in-memory database and runs in an insecure way.

| Presentation given at DevOpsDays Montreal. | [Slides]() |

| Repository | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [repo1-iac-vault](/repo1-iac-vault/) | The infrastructure code (Terraform) that spins up a HashiCorp Vault container on AWS ECS with Fargate. |
| [repo2-code-myapp-build](/repo2-code-myapp-build/) | The test application code for building and publishing to the container registry (AWS ECR). |
| [repo3-iac-myapp-deploy](/repo3-iac-myapp-deploy/) | The infrastructure code (Terraform) that launches the test application container on AWS ECS with Fargate. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [GitHub Actions/Workflows](/.github/workflows) | Pipelines that automate application build and deployment steps. |

## Actions secrets and variables

Variable and secret configurations that need to be made in the GitHub repository.

| Type | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Variable | VAULT_ADDR | HTTP address of the Vault server. The DNS name will be shown in the output of the Terraform run that creates the environment in AWS. The value will be something like `http://<vault.address>:8200/` |
| Secret | AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | Specifies an AWS access key associated with an IAM account. |
| Secret | AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | Specifies the secret key associated with the access key. |
| Secret | PAT | The GitHub fine-grained `personal access token` with access to trigger the `repo3-iac-myapp-deploy` repo pipeline (permissions: `Read access to metadata` and `Read and Write access to contents`). |
| Secret | ROLE_ID | The RoleID generated by Vault for the application. |
| Secret | VAULT_TOKEN | The token generated by the Vault with access to request the wrapped SecretID. |

## AWS config - Vault deploy

Launch HashiCorp Vault using the [Terraform code](/repo1-iac-vault/).

```sh
# cria backend S3
aws s3 mb s3://devopsdays-statefiles
aws s3 ls

# inicializar terraform
cd repo1-iac-vault/
terraform init -backend-config=environment/dev/backend.tfvars

# exibir o plano de execucao, o que sera alterado
terraform plan -var-file=environment/dev/terraform.tfvars -var hashicorp_dev_root_token=root_pwd

# aplicar
terraform apply -var-file=environment/dev/terraform.tfvars -var hashicorp_dev_root_token=root_pwd

# para destruir o ambiente ao final dos testes
terraform destroy -var-file=environment/dev/terraform.tfvars -var hashicorp_dev_root_token=root_pwd
```

## Vault config

Configuring HashiCorp Vault to support the `AppRole authentication method` used to deploy the app.

### instalar Vault client ou executar um container com o client
- https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/getting-started/getting-started-install
- docker run --rm -it --entrypoint sh hashicorp/vault:1.18

```sh
# Set Vault environment variables
# This will configure the Vault client to talk to the dev server
export VAULT_ADDR='http://devopsdays-vault-ingress-132772647.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com:8200'
export VAULT_TOKEN='root_pwd'
```

```sh
# Enable key/value secrets engine to store secrets if needed
#vault secrets enable -path=secret -version=2 kv

vault kv put \
  -mount secret \
  pipelines/myapp/dev \
  DB_USER="user" DB_PASS="pass" DB_HOST="mydb-host.local" ADMIN_EMAIL="admin@devopsdays"

# Enable AppRole auth
vault auth enable approle

# Create a policy for the app
vault policy write app-myapp - << EOF
# MyApp - Read-only permission on secrets
path "secret/data/pipelines/myapp/dev" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
EOF

# Creates a role named myapp with app-myapp policy attached
vault write auth/approle/role/myapp \
  token_policies="app-myapp" \
  token_num_uses=5 \
  token_ttl=10m \
  token_max_ttl=20m \
  token_bound_cidrs="10.0.48.0/24","10.0.49.0/24" \
  token_no_default_policy=true \
  secret_id_ttl=10m \
  secret_id_num_uses=1 \
  secret_id_bound_cidrs="10.0.48.0/24","10.0.49.0/24"

# Get RoleID
vault read auth/approle/role/myapp/role-id

# MyApp identity/token - Can get the roles's secret-id
vault policy write approle-myapp-secret - << EOF
# This effectively makes response wrapping mandatory for this path by setting min_wrapping_ttl to 1 second.
# This also sets this path's wrapped response maximum allowed TTL to 90 seconds.
path "auth/approle/role/myapp/secret-id" {
    capabilities = ["update"]
    min_wrapping_ttl = "1s"
    max_wrapping_ttl = "300s"
}
EOF

# Create the identity with access to get the wrapped approle secretid
vault token create -orphan -policy=approle-myapp-secret -no-default-policy -ttl=87600h -display-name=MyAppIdentity


# Retrieve a wrapped SecretID
vault write -wrap-ttl=300s -force -field=wrapping_token auth/approle/role/myapp/secret-id
# Unwrap the SecretID
VAULT_TOKEN="" vault unwrap -field=secret_id

vault write auth/approle/login role_id="" secret_id=""
export APP_TOKEN=""
VAULT_TOKEN=$APP_TOKEN vault kv get secret/pipelines/myapp/dev
```

## Deploy the app

Create a tag to trigger the app's build and deploy pipeline.

```sh
git tag v1
git push origin v1
```
